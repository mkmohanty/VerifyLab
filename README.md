Automating the assessment of programming lab assignments.

The objective of this project is to develop a tool that enables both teachers and students to easily keep track of the lab assignments. Students can take advantage of this tool to test their codes for expected solutions. Teachers can use this tool to evaluate student assignments and can have a quick view of each student's performance status.

The goal here is to make this tool simple and lightweight, so that it can be easily installed and used even with very low hardware configurations.
